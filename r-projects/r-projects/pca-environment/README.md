# Principal Component Analysis - Environment

## Description
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to environmental data for dimensionality reduction and pattern identification.

## Objective
- Perform PCA on environmental variables
- Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance
- Visualize principal components
- Interpret results in environmental context

## Methods
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Scree plots and variance explained
- Biplot visualization
- Component interpretation
- R Markdown for reproducible analysis

## File
- `pca_environnement.Rmd` - Main analysis script (R Markdown)

## How to Use
```r
# Open in RStudio
# Knit the document to generate report
# Or run chunks interactively for exploration
```

## Output
HTML/PDF report with:
- PCA results and eigenvalues
- Scree plots
- Biplots
- Component loadings
- Interpretation

## Requirements
```r
# Install required packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "FactoMineR", "factoextra", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
```
